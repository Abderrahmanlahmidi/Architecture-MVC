# Architecture-MVC
This project aims to design a clean and modular MVC architecture in PHP, with PostgreSQL as database. The objective is to have a strict separation of responsibilities, a back office for administration and a front office for public display. The architecture should be extensible, secure and well-structured, applying good development practices.
